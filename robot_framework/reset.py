"""This module handles resetting the state of the computer so the robot can work with a clean slate.

For this robot the "state" is the GO connection and the cached OO credentials.
``open_all`` opens them and returns a :class:`Client`; ``reset`` re-opens them,
so the queue framework can reconnect on a retry instead of reconnecting for
every single document.
